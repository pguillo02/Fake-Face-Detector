Fake face detector developed for AA2 course. Multimodel project designed for detecting fake face images of different people, angles and perspectives. Developed in python through the pytorch framework, it takes advange of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) properties for performing an accurate classification. This repository contains the arquitecture of two different models: a "made from scratch" model and a tranfer learning model generated with the convolutional layers of the well known model resNet18.
